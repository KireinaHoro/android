# We enable sysroot support for gcc and binutils
# here. gen_usr_ldscript from toolchain-funcs inject full path into
# the ld script wrapper, which results in double prefix. Furthermore,
# the original motivation of this helper (bug #4411), putting dynamic
# library into /lib and static one into /usr/lib while linking to
# dynamic one first, does not apply Prefix as we don't rely on
# {/usr,}/lib separation.
